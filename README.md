# Abstract
Predicting drug–drug interaction (DDI) events is critical for ensuring patient safety, optimizing
therapeutic efficacy, and advancing drug discovery. Deep learning–based models have recently
attracted considerable attention in this domain and achieved promising results. However, most
existing approaches insufficiently account for both the chemical structural information of drugs
and the multiplicity of interaction types, thereby limiting predictive accuracy. Here we present
ChemDDI, a chemically information-enhanced deep learning framework for DDI event prediction.
Specifically, ChemDDI employs multi-view graph- and image-based augmentation methods to
extract chemical structural information from three-dimensional conformations. Building on these
chemically-informed representations, ChemDDI incorporates multi-relational interaction information
through graph neural networks and knowledge graph embeddings, while contrastive learning constraints
further align interaction features for robust DDI event prediction. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that ChemDDI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with substantial
gains on rare interaction events. Code is available at https://github.com/ge165/DLOU165.git
